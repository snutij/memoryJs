# Memory

The object of the game is to collect the most matching pairs in the time available.

I made this app to practice my JavaScript classes in 2017, it is not up to date. Feel free to use it, read the code, optimize, whatever you want with this repo!

# Setting Up the Game

Choose your difficulty mode :

- Easy : 50 seconds - 8 pairs
- Normal : 60 seconds - 14 pairs
- Hard : 90 seconds - 18 pairs

Play !

# Rules : 

- If your try of pair is wrong you can't select another card during 1 second
- If your try of pair is good you can select directly another card
- You win only if you find all pairs in the time available
